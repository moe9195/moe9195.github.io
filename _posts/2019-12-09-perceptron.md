## A collection of various data science and machine learning projects that I've previously worked on.

### [Diagnosing Pneumonia using Chest X-Ray Images](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/moe9195/Machine-Learning-Projects/blob/master/chest_xray.ipynb)

Using chest x-ray images to diagnose pneumonia using convolutional neural networks. I implement a neural network with five hidden convolutional layers followed by a fully connected layer, which I train on 5638 labelled x-ray images. The model is then tested on a test set and had an accuracy of 84.48%

Here's some math:

$$z=x+y$$

You can also put it inline $$z=x+y$$
