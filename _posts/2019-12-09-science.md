## A collection of various computational science projects that I've previously worked on.

### [2-Dimensional Diffusion using Gray-Scott Model](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/moe9195/Diffusion/blob/master/2D_diffusion.ipynb)

I perform a simulation of two chemicals (A and B) reacting and diffusing on a 2D grid using the Gray-Scott model.

Chemical A is added at a certain "feed" rate. Two Bs convert an A into a B (reaction). Chemical B is removed at a certain "kill" rate. The system can be approximated by using two numbers at each grid cell for the local concentrations of A and B. The concentration ranges from 0 to 1, under the restriction $$0 \leq A+B \leq 1$$. Both A and B diffuse so uneven concentrations spread out across the grid, however, A diffuses faster than B. When a large grid with many cells is simulated, complex patterns can emerge.
 
The grid is repeatedly updated to update the concentrations A and B of each cell using the following system of equations:

$$A' = A + (D_{A}\nabla^{2}A - AB^{2} + f(1-A))\Delta t$$
and
$$B' = B + (D_{b}\nabla^{2}B + AB^{2} - (k+f)B)\Delta t$$

where $$A'$$ and $$B'$$ are the new values for the concentrations, $$A$$ and $$B$$ are the previous values for the concentration, $D_{a}$ and $$D_{b}$$ are the diffusion rates for A and B, $$f(1-A)$$ is the feed rate scaled by $$(1-A)$$ so $$A$$ doesn't exceed 1.0.

$$\Delta t$$ is the time step for each iteration, $$k$$ is the kill rate which is scaled by $B$ so it doesn't go below 0 ($$f$$ is added to $$k$$ so the kill rate is never less than the feed rate).

The $$AB^{2}$$ terms account for the reaction rate, where the chance that 1 $$A$$ and 2 $$B$$ will come together is $$A*B*B$$. Since $$A$$ is converted to $$B$$ in the case of a reaction, this amount is subtracted from $$A$$ and added to $$B$$.

$$\nabla^{2}A$$ and $$\nabla^{2}B$$ are the Laplacians of A and B, which gives the difference between the average of nearby grid cells and the centre cell. This simulates diffusion as $$A$$ and $$B$$ become more like their neighbours. The Laplacian is performed with a convolution using the 3x3 kernel given by

$$\begin{bmatrix}
0.05 & 0.2 & 0.05\\ 
0.2 & -1 & 0.2\\ 
0.05 & 0.2 & 0.05
\end{bmatrix}$$

The grid is initialised with $$A = 1$$, $$B = 0$$ and a small area is seeded with $$B = 1$$.

Adjusting the two parameters for the feed rate and kill rate can produce a large range of results. We can visualise the grid by assigning each cell a colour based on its $$A$$ and $$B$$ values. For a large discussion on the parameter values and their respective patterns, see Robert Munafo's [detailed page](http://mrob.com/pub/comp/xmorphia/pearson-classes.html) on the subject.

### [3-Dimensional Diffusion using Gray-Scott Model](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/moe9195/Diffusion/blob/master/2D_diffusion.ipynb)
 
 The Gray-Scott model is implemented in 3 dimensions. This involves adding another dimension to the 2-D grid used in the 2 dimensional case. This extra dimension, however, adds difficulties in computation and visualisation. 

The mathematical model for the three dimensional case is the same as the two dimensional case, where the concentrations of A and B are updated following the system of equations:

$$A' = A + (D_{A}\nabla^{2}A - AB^{2} + f(1-A))\Delta t$$
and
$$B' = B + (D_{b}\nabla^{2}B + AB^{2} - (k+f)B)\Delta t$$

The diffusion operator $$\nabla^2$$ needs to be modified to three dimensions. This can be done using a 3D kernel. Here, we use an unbiased kernel with a centre value of -1 and surrounding values of 1/26. Other kernels can be used for different results.

The numpy arrays are then converted to VTK files for and visualised with [Paraview](https://www.paraview.org/).

### [Fourier Transform of Light Diffracting Through N-Pinholes](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/moe9195/DiffractionPatterns/blob/master/DiffractionPatterns.ipynb)

I compute the Fourier tranform of light intensity, where the light is going through n pinholes, diffracting and interfering on a wall. This produces very beautiful patterns, and by changing the parameters, an extraordinarily large number of different patterns can be generated. I also wrote built a GUI using Tkinter to quickly generate these patterns in 2:1 aspect ratio and 2880x1440 resolution, to be used as smartphone backgrounds. The GUI app is posted on my [github](https://github.com/moe9195/DiffractionPatterns/blob/master/background_generator.py)

### [Spherical Triangulation using Grid Method and Octahedral Method](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/moe9195/SphereTriangulation/blob/master/sphere_triangulation_methods.ipynb)

Two methods of triangulating a sphere are discussed. The first method uses spherical coordinates to triangulate a sphere in a longitude-latitude fashion. The second method uses octahedrons. A method for calculating the solid angles of the spherical triangles is discussed and implemented. Moreover, a method to calculate the centroids of the spherical triangles is also discussed and implemented.

### [Rubber Physics](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/moe9195/RubberPhysics/blob/master/elastomers_deformation_models.ipynb)

Implementating a collection of methods for modelling the mechanical behaviour of elastomers. I discuss and implement the 3-chain, 4-chain, and 8-chain models for rubber behaviour.

### [Spherical Model for Rubber Elasticity](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/moe9195/spherical_model_rubber_elasticity/blob/master/JupyterNotebook.ipynb)


I propose a numerical model for modelling the behaviour of elastomers under deformations. The proposed model is based on a spherically oriented network of polydisperse N chain. It contains five physically motivated parameters and two computational parameters which need to be determined on the basis of experimental data.

The model is able to predict experimental results under uniaxial deformation, equibiaxial deformation and pure shear with excellent accuracy. The inclusion of a damage parameter allows for the prediction of the [Mullins effect](https://abaqus-docs.mit.edu/2017/English/SIMACAEMATRefMap/simamat-c-mullins.htm) and the innate representative directions due to the spherical orientation of the network predicts anisotropic softening in agreement with experiment.

This work is based on my [masters thesis](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Sbm8yCoAqp042DqZWpC2vrmxCLPt74Et/view?usp=sharing) which I suggest reading for a full understanding of the model. I also suggest looking at the previous two projects first to understand the functions used in this project.

The relevant functions used are posted on my [github.](https://github.com/moe9195/spherical_model_rubber_elasticity/blob/master/RubberElasticity.py)
