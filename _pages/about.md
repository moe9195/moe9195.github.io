Hi! I am Mohammad Rahmeh, but most just call me Moe.

I originally studied Physics to a BSc level at the American University of Beirut. In 2017, I moved to the United Kingdom to pursue a Masters in Materials Science from the University of Nottingham. After graduation, I moved into the machine learning field.

For the past year, I've been working with the American University of Beirut, in collaboration with the University of Rochester, as a research assistant. My work has focused on using deep learning for ocean flow predictions- more specificy, predicting regions of high vorticity in the Gulf Stream region from temperature and kinetic energy data.

Aside from work, I've been independently working on various projects in data science and machine learning, as well as some computational science and visualisation projects.

My main programming language is Python but I also have extensive experience using Matlab/Octave. I've worked with the three main deep learning libraries in Python (Keras, Tensorflow and Pytorch), but I'm most experienced using Keras. I am also experienced in various visualisation tools such as Paraview, Plotly and MayaVi.

I've created this website to share some of the projects I've been working on, mainy using Python. I hope you find the things I am sharing useful to you! This website is a work in progress and if you have any feedback, please feel free to send me an e-mail!
